	After decades of violence, chaos and useless military intervention done by the united nations in Haiti, the caribbean country faces the same problems as always. After some internatiocal pressure, a humanitary aid was (re)deployed by united nations trying to help the poor population of Haiti. The humanitary mission was a complete failure, most of the united nation assets was stolen by local gangs that controls 90% of the haitian territory. A group of united nation workers were taken hostage from local gangs that demands for money in exchange of their lifes. The USG prepares a Task Force from the 75th Ranger Regiment to rescue the hostages and intimidate haitian gangs to avoid any harm to US citizens.<br/>
